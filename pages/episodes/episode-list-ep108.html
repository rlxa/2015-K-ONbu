						<h3>"Freshman Reception!"</h3><br>
						<p>Ui enters Yui's school as a freshman, as well as her classmate Azusa Nakano. When the class arrangements are announced, Yui, Mugi and Ritsu end up in the same class, while Mio ends up in a different class with Nodoka. The group puts up with Sawako's ideas of promoting the club by dressing them up as animals, even though it seems to be having the opposite effect. Ui and her classmate, Jun Suzuki, visit the club only to find everyone dressed as maids, but the girls soon change into tracksuits after finding it impossible to play while wearing the maid outfits. Meanwhile, Azusa walks around looking for a club that is right for her, initially passing up the light music club because they don't seem serious. The light music club gets ready for another live performance at the Freshman Welcome assembly, but Mio is still too embarrassed to do the vocals, so Yui does them instead. Yui forgets about the lyrics at the beginning of a song, but Mio manages to get over her shyness and back her up. Ui brings Azusa to watch the show, and Azusa is moved so much by it that she decides to join the club.</p><br>
