						<h3>"Drummer!"</h3><br>
						<p>After noticing how badly she shows up in videos of the band's performances, Ritsu decides she does not want to be the drummer anymore as she does not stand out enough. She tries playing the guitar but cannot get beyond the basics. She tries the keyboard next, but only goes as far as playing with all the sound effects. The next day, Yui tries coming up with various ways to make Ritsu stand out, with no such luck. Later that night, Ritsu recalls when she first started drumming and practicing every day. After watching a DVD of The Who, she realizes that even though she is not always in the spotlight, she loves playing the drums. The next day, Tsumugi shows off a new song that Ritsu helped her come up with when Ritsu is learning how to play the keyboard.</p><br>
