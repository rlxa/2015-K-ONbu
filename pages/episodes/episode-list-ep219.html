						<h3>"Romeo and Juliet!"</h3><br>
						<p>As the seniors prepare for the play, Azusa worries that there has not been enough practice for the live performance. As the play goes on, the backstage crew realize they are missing Juliet's gravestone needed for the climax, but manage to borrow something from the occult club in time. After a successful play, the girls apologize to Azusa for making her worry and decide to hold an overnight practice session at school. Later that night, they browse through the closed stalls, where they find the missing gravestone, and give their thanks to the occult club. The next morning, Sawako gives the girls special Ho-kago Tea Time t-shirts for their performance.</p><br>
