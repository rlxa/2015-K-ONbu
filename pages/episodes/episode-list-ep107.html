						<h3>"Christmas!"</h3><br>
						<p>Yui's sister Ui Hirasawa remembers how Yui once attempted to give her a white Christmas when they were little, by putting pillow-stuffing on the tree outside. Ritsu decides to hold a Christmas party for the club, and while her initial plans of holding it at Tsumugi's house fail, they eventually decide to have it at Yui's house while Yui's parents are on vacation. Yui's friend Nodoka Manabe also gets an invitation. The girls decide to hold a gift exchange at the party, and go shopping for various gifts. Ui prepares a lovely Christmas dinner for the group, which gets a little out of hand when Sawako shows up out of nowhere. After the gift exchange, Yui and Ui end up giving each other just the right warm accessories for the winter. After the rest of the group leaves, snow falls and Yui and Ui decide to sleep together; unfortunately for Ui, Yui ends up hogging the sheets. In the New Year, the club decides to go to the shrine to make their New Year wishes.</p><br>
