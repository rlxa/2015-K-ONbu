						<h3>"Live House!"</h3><br>
						<p>Ritsu's old middle school friend invites the band to perform at a live house on New Year's Eve. After checking the place out and handing out tickets to their friends, they soon get to know some of the other performing bands as they set up their routine. The girls have a bit of trouble while rehearsing, but the other bands encourage them to keep trying. They then perform to a packed room with great success, while Sawako meets one of her old friends. Afterward, everyone goes to Yui's house to see the new year in, although only Mio and Ritsu manage to stay up until midnight. Yui wakes everyone up to see the first sunrise of the new year.</p><br>
