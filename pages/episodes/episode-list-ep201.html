						<h3>"Seniors!"</h3><br>
						<p>Yui and the other girls start their third year at high school (Azusa's second). Yui, Mio, Ritsu and Tsumugi are surprised that they, along with Nodoka, have been put into the same class. It soon becomes apparent that their new homeroom teacher, none other than Sawako, had arranged it that way so she had fewer names to remember. With Azusa being the only second year of the light music club, the gang become determined to get new members so that she will not be the sole member when they graduate. However, their various attempts to attract new students fail, so they focus instead on their performance for the freshman reception. Azusa becomes depressed that no new members show up afterward, but after talking with Ui and Jun and overhearing Yui's comments, she decides it is fine with just the five of them for now.</p><br>
