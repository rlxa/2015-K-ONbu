						<h3>"Hot!"</h3><br>
						<p>During an unbearably hot day, the girls have trouble beating off the heat and also notice Ton shedding in its current aquarium tank. After dragging Sawako away from the air-conditioned staff room (partly to give Tsumugi a ride back to her house to get a bigger tank for Ton), the girls wonder why the club room does not have an air conditioner. After inquiring with Nodoka about it, it turns out that Ritsu never sent in a request for an air conditioner due to her never attending any student council club meetings. After pleading to the student council, the club room gets one installed. However, Yui slumps over, having forgotten that she is weak to air conditioning.</p><br>
