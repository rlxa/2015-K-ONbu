						<h3>"Abolition of the Club!"</h3><br>
						<p>Yui Hirasawa has just started her high school life, but does not know if she should join a club or not. Ritsu Tainaka wants to reform the light music club, which will be disbanded by the end of April if at least four members cannot be found. Ritsu convinces her friend Mio Akiyama to join the light music club instead of the literature club. Tsumugi Kotobuki, originally intending to join the choir club, also agrees to join. In their search for a fourth member, the three put up a poster for the club which catches Yui's eye. Misunderstanding the term 'light music', Yui submits a form only to realize they are looking for someone to play a guitar, which she cannot play. Despite this, the three members try to get Yui to stay, and after playing a short piece for her, Yui decides joins the club and learn the guitar, which she first has to buy.</p><br>
