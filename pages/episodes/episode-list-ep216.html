						<h3>"Upperclassmen!"</h3><br>
						<p>When Azusa comes to the realization that the light music club has been slacking as of late, she becomes determined to practice more. Azusa runs into Tsumugi alone in the club room and tries giving her some guitar lessons. She later is about to get a chance to practice alone with Mio, but is interrupted when Ritsu requires help from Mio and the girls end up spending the evening at Ritsu's house. The next day, Azusa runs into Yui in the club room hoping to practice, but ends up cleaning Ton's tank and helping her with understanding how to play the song Tsumugi composed, as she cannot read sheet music. Yui reminds Azusa that she is who she is, and personalizes her keychain.</p><br>
