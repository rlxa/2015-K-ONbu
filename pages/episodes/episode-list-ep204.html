						<h3>"Field Trip"</h3><br>
						<p>The third years go on a school field trip to Kyoto. On the train there, Mio is a little annoyed at Yui's and Ritsu's childish behavior. Mio realizes that she will have to watch over both of them during the trip. After visiting various shrines and attractions, the group returns to the inn where the girls' bad habits continue to annoy Mio as well as Sawako. The next day, they have a look around Kyoto, though Mio laments that no one wants to participate in any tourist activities. However, when they get lost on the way back to the train station along with Nodoka's group, Mio gives in to the jokey nature of the others and loosens up for the rest of the trip.</p><br>
