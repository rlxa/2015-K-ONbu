						<h3>"Teacher!"</h3><br>
						<p>After Sawako gets a call on her phone from someone in the clubroom, the girls decide to follow her. They find her meeting up with one of her friends, and although they are easily noticed by her, she does not alert Sawako to their position. After Sawako leaves, her friend introduces herself to the others as Norimi, a guitarist from the previous light music club's band, Death Devil. She reveals that one of their classmates is getting married and asked Death Devil to perform at the wedding reception, but Norimi cannot convince Sawako to join up with them due to her current image. When Yui and the others are unable to convincing Sawako, Yui ends up taking the guitarist role in the band, much to Sawako's surprise. However, when Yui messes up and starts giving the band a cute image, Sawako steps up on stage to take Yui's place to show everyone what Death Devil is really about. Despite her secret shame being found out, she still remains popular with the freshmen.</p><br>
