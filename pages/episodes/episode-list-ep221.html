						<h3>"Yearbook!"</h3><br>
						<p>With photos for the graduation yearbook coming up, Yui uses Ui as a model to determine the best hairstyle, though feels weird when she leaves her hairpin on her. Although the seniors have finished their clubs, the girls decide to use the music room to study for their entrance exams, though Yui and Ritsu still have yet to decide on their university choices. While trying to trim her bangs for her yearbook photo, Yui sneezes and accidentally cuts them off, giving her a completely different look. After their pictures are taken, the girls learn Mio had turned down a recommendation for a university because she wanted to study together with everyone. Upon hearing this, Yui, Ritsu and Mio turn in their university preference applications to Sawako, opting to go to the same women's university as Tsumugi.</p><br>
