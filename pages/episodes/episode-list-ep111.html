						<h3>"Crisis!"</h3><br>
						<p>When Ritsu is reminded by Nodoka to fill in the stage-use application in advance, the band notices they do not have a name yet. Azusa notices rust on Yui's guitar strings, and it becomes apparent that Yui has never given her guitar maintenance before. They take it to the guitar shop, where Mio is entranced by rare left-handed guitars. After the guitar is repaired, Yui realizes that she has to pay for the maintenance service, but didn't bring any money. Tsumugi offers to pay, but the staff refuse to take money from her, telling her to consider it a free service. Later, Ritsu starts to become jealous of Mio spending time with Nodoka and begins to fall out with her. She ends up with a fever, so Mio visits and smooths things over, joined later by the other girls. Back at school, a recovered Ritsu gets in trouble for failing to turn in the application form on time, but Nodoka backs her up in front of the student council. Since the girls are unable to decide on a name for the band, Sawako makes an executive decision and assigns the name "Hokago Tea Time" to the band. Unfortunately, Yui ends up catching Ritsu's cold.</p><br>
