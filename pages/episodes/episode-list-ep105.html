						<h3>"Mentor!"</h3><br>
						<p>The light music club is still not officially recognized, as they did not turn in a club form months before and have yet to find an adviser. The girls ask the music teacher Sawako Yamanaka to be their adviser. Though she initially refuses, it is discovered that she used to be a member of the previous light music club, and was into death metal, and Ritsu uses that fact to blackmail her into becoming the adviser. As the club still needs a vocalist and lyrics, Mio writes a song called "Light and Fluffy Time", which - despite protests from Ritsu - is accepted. Since Mio is too embarrassed to sing, Yui offers instead, but she cannot sing and play guitar simultaneously. Sawako teaches her to do so, but after all the training, she loses her voice. With only three days left to the school festival, Mio must perform the vocals herself.</p><br>
