						<h3>"Special Training!"</h3><br>
						<p>Yui and the girls are now taking their midterms. Unfortunately, Yui practices playing her guitar chords instead of studying, and she fails the exams. If she fails the retest, she cannot participate in club activities, and the club will be disbanded due to lack of members. A day before the retest, Yui still has not been able to study much and begs Ritsu, Mio and Tsumugi to help her; Mio comes through, while Ritsu is more hinderance than help. Days after the retest, an exhausted Yui returns to the club room with perfect marks. To celebrate, the girls ask Yui to play the guitar chords she had learned, only to find that Yui has completely forgotten them.</p><br>
