						<h3>"Leading Role!"</h3><br>
						<p>Much to their dismay, Mio and Ritsu are respectively nominated for the roles of Romeo and Juliet in the class play. Mio has her usual problems with the pressure of being center stage, while Ritsu cannot act lady-like enough for her role. After not being impressed with the other girls' 'training' for them, Ritsu and Mio decide to have a cram session. While doing impersonations of each other if they switched roles, they find the key to successfully acting out their parts. Noticing Mio still lacks confidence, Tsumugi arranges for her and the others to work as maids in her family's cafe to help get over her embarrassment. Although she gains some confidence, Mio insists it is different from being on stage. Meanwhile, Azusa grows concerned that, with everyone rehearsing for the play, no one is preparing for the live concert.</p><br>
