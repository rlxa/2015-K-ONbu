						<h3>"School Festival!"</h3><br>
						<p>On the day of the school festival, an anxious Mio wants to practice for the club's live event, but everyone else is obligated helping with their classes' other stands. They later get some practice done, but Mio is still nervous about singing center stage, with Sawako's costume choices not helping her mood. Ritsu holds a mock concert introduction to calm Mio's nerves. Although she still has jitters when the concert starts, the others encourage Mio to do her best, having seen practicing diligently beforehand. The show manages to be a success! However, leaving the stage Mio trips over the guitar cable and accidentally exposes her underwear to the audience. She ends up getting a fan club, but is traumatized by her embarrassment.</p><br>
