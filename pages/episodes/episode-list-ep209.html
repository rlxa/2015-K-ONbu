						<p>As finals approach, Yui struggles with her studies. One of Yui's neighbors, a kindly old lady who is always taken care of her, tells Yui about an upcoming talent show event taking place right after finals. Wanting to pay her back, Yui decides to enter, though the others are concerned about her juggling two priorities. Azusa decides to join her act and help her study for finals. After their tests, Yui and Azusa perform their routine. Though they do not win, Yui gives her participation prize to the old lady as thanks. Yui manages to pass her tests with high scores.</p><br>
