						<h3>Voiced by: Asumi Kodama (Japanese)</h3><br>
						<p>Megumi was the president of the student council before Nodoka succeeded her in her third year, and she is also the president of Mio's fan club, who is later succeeded by Nodoka. She stalks Mio during her last few days in high school because she wanted to see Mio one more time. The band offers her a song as a graduation gift. She later becomes friends with Ritsu, mentioning she is at the same university the others intend to go to.</p><br>
