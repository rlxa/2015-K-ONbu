						<h3>Voiced by: Asakawa Yu (Japanese)</h3><br>
						<p>Kawaguchi Norimi attended Sakura High with Sawako, and like her, is a former guitarist in the heavy metal band Death Devil. She comes back into Sawako's life to reunite the band so that they can perform at a former classmate's wedding reception, but Sawako initially refuses. Norimi then approaches the current light music club for help, but when they too are unable to convince Sawako, Norimi somehow talks them into replacing Sawako at the performance. Norimi eventually gets what she wanted all along: when Sawako sees the poor job that her students are doing as a heavy metal band, she jumps onstage in order to save Death Devil's reputation.</p><br>
