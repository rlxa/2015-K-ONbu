						<span><strong>Ho-kago Tea Time (HTT)</strong> is the name of the band consisting of members of the Sakura High Light Music Club: Yui Hirasawa, Ritsu Tainaka, Mio Akiyama, Tsumugi Kotobuki and later on Azusa Nakano.<br>
						In one episode, the four girls were thinking of a name for their band. Since they couldn't think of any, Sawako butted in and named their band.<br>
						The band primarily performs at major school events (which Ritsu almost always forgets to sign them up for). They have also been invited to play at public and private functions (club, wedding, local talent show) and have even hosted a small concert at school.<br></span>
